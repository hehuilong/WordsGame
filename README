Makefile is in the directory "src"

Use the ELF executable "test" in console for testing the game functions with a text interface

Use the ELF executable "wordgame" to play with GTK interface.

I want the placement of words in the grid to be randomized.

Say the size of grille is N*N, the length of longest word is L and the number of words is M.

The M words are randomly picked up from a dictionary.
 
1st step:

Generate M sequences of N*N integers without duplication from 1 to N*N which can represent the positions in the grid.

Randomize the order of these number sequences by shuffling technique.

Time: o(M*N*N)
 
2nd step:

Generate M sequences of 8 integers without duplication from 1 to 8 which can represent the directions in the grid.

Randomize the order of these number sequences by shuffling technique.

Time : o(8*M)
 
3rd step:

Put M words in the grid using DFS.

The DFS order for each word is based on the sequences generated.

Time : o(N*N*8*L*M)

I've successfully deployed Apache server for C language CGIs on Ubuntu 11 using the following configuration.

Configuration file of Apache: (file path on Ubuntu 11: /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default)

<VirtualHost *:80>
	ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost

	DocumentRoot /var/www
	<Directory />

I've deployed the web app in "/var/www" , and CGIs in "/var/www/cgi-bin".
